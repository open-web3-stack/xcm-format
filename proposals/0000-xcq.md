## Summary

This RFC propose a new instruction to support XCQ(Cross-Consensus Query Language). XCQ is designed to provide an universal way to query onchain data across different consensus system.

## Motivation

XCM enables mutable interactions across different consensus systems.
But we still need another subsystem to query information across different consensus systems, which abstract away the concrete implementations in these systems.

Such a subsystem will benefit the tools and UI developers.
For example, for a substrate-based chain, an account can have different value-bearing assets in different pallets (i.e. balances pallet, DEX pallet, liquid staking pallet). Conventionally, wallet developers has no easy way but examine all the pallets to scrape all the information they need. Some operations require reading storage directly, which is also subject to breaking changes.

The proposal of XCQ will serve as a layer between specific chain implementations and tools/UI developers.
Common reusable view functions are supported through an extension-based design in a permission-less manner. Given the result of these view functions, complex computations can be performed through a prebuilt program.

## Specification

The proposed change introduce a new instruction:

```rust
ReportQuery {
  query: SizeLimitedXcq,
  weight_limit: Option<Weight>,
  info: QueryResponseInfo,
}
```

The `SizeLimitedXcq` is a blob

### Implemention details

### Errors

## Security considerations

## Impact

No impact to the rest of the spec. There are new, independent instructions, no changes to existing instructions.

## Alternatives

- What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them?

Although there is a view function PR Defining view functions will be immutable, so and it's a permissioned process and will need a runtime upgrade everytime. However, XCQ can be used in a quick iteration developments.

- What is the impact of not doing this?
